## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate action when any instances of unacceptable behavior are reported.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to:

- Remove or edit any comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct.

## Scope

- Email: `**support@destinationaustralia.com**`

All reports will be reviewed and investigated confidentially, and appropriate actions will be taken to address the issue.

## Enforcement

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Project maintainers may take further action, such as temporary bans, removal from the project, or other necessary actions to uphold the community standards.
